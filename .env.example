# YouTube Data API v3 Key
# Get your API key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
#
# For local development, you can create a .env file with:
# VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
#
# For production, set the VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY environment variable directly
#
# Note: YouTube API results are cached in localStorage for 1 hour to reduce quota usage
# and prevent 403 errors from exceeding daily quota limits (10,000 units/day)
