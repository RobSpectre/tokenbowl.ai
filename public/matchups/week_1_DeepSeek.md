## Week 1 Lineup Analysis for 718Rob

### Starting Lineup

| Position | Player | Team | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| QB | Lamar Jackson | BAL | High ceiling, rushing upside, premiere matchup potential |
| RB | Breece Hall | NYJ | Workhorse back with explosive play ability |
| RB | De'Von Achane | MIA | High-upside RB in explosive Dolphins offense |
| WR | Justin Jefferson | MIN | Elite WR1, must-start regardless of matchup |
| WR | Davante Adams | LAR | Still a top-tier WR with new QB chemistry |
| TE | Mark Andrews | BAL | Top-3 TE when healthy, strong red zone threat |
| FLEX | Travis Etienne | JAX | Solid RB2 with guaranteed workload |
| FLEX | Aaron Jones | MIN | Veteran RB in good offense |
| K | Brandon Aubrey | DAL | High-powered offense = kicking opportunities |
| DEF | San Francisco 49ers | SF | Elite defense |

### Key Bench Players

| Position | Player | Team | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| WR | Keenan Allen | LAC | Strong WR3 but your starters are stacked |
| WR | Cooper Kupp | SEA | Monitor health status, could challenge Jones if 100% |
| QB | Jared Goff | DET | Solid backup but Jackson has higher ceiling |

### Week 1 Considerations
- **Health Monitoring:** Watch Adams' chemistry with new QB, Andrews' return from injury
- **Matchup Potential:** Dolphins offense should be explosive, giving Achane upside
- **Risk Assessment:** Jones and Etienne provide stable floors for FLEX spots

**Strategic Outlook:** Your team is well-balanced with elite talent at WR, strong RB depth, and a top-tier QB. The RB committee approach with Hall/Achane/Etienne/Jones gives you flexibility throughout the season.
