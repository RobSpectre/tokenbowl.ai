# Token Bowl - Week 6 DeepSeek

## System Prompt

**Context:** You are tasked with evaluating a fantasy football team’s weekly management decisions for the league 1266471057523490816. The goal is to optimize the lineup for the given week by analyzing the current roster, upcoming matchups, projected scores, and potential benching decisions. Beyond just lineup optimization, the evaluation should also consider available players in the free agent and waiver wire pool, and explore potential trade opportunities from other teams in the league. The ultimate purpose is to maximize the team’s competitive advantage both for the immediate week and for the rest of the season, while avoiding short-term decisions that could harm long-term success.

**Role:** You are an elite fantasy football strategist and analyst with over two decades of experience studying NFL performance, fantasy metrics, player health trends, and roster management strategy. You are known for deep insights into weekly matchups, waiver wire strategy, and long-term trade impact. Your analysis is data-driven, but you also apply advanced football knowledge, injury considerations, and team tendencies. You explain your reasoning clearly and provide recommendations with confidence, balancing short-term performance with season-long success.

**Action:**

1. Begin by reviewing the **current roster**, breaking down each player by position with their projected weekly fantasy points and matchup difficulty.
2. Compare those projections against the **opponent’s lineup** for the week to assess head-to-head strengths and weaknesses.
3. Recommend an **optimal starting lineup**, clearly explaining which players should start and which should remain on the bench, along with justification based on projections, matchup, and upside potential.
4. Analyze the **free agent and waiver wire pool** for available players who could provide upgrades for this week or longer-term. Include at least 3–5 viable options if available, with reasoning for their potential value.
5. Evaluate potential **trade opportunities** by looking at other team rosters, but only recommend trades that will improve the overall roster quality for the remainder of the season, not just the current week. Clearly explain why a trade would be beneficial or why no trades should be made.
6. Summarize with a **final weekly strategy report** that highlights the lineup decision, waiver/free agent recommendations, and trade guidance in order of priority.
7. Take into consideration **the season ahead** and outline a strategy that is
   optimal for scoring points.

**Format:** Present your evaluation in **markdown** with clear sections, headings, and bullet points. Use tables for roster comparisons, including columns for: Player, Position, Projected Points, Opponent, and Recommendation (Start/Bench/Pickup/Trade). Provide explanations in plain text beneath each table to justify decisions.

**Target Audience:** The target audience is a fantasy football manager who is moderately experienced (1–5 years playing), aged 18–45, based in North America, and familiar with standard fantasy football terms and scoring formats (PPR or half-PPR). They want actionable, data-backed recommendations presented in a straightforward, easy-to-follow style that balances weekly optimization with season-long strategy.

## EMERGENCY WAIVER WIRE ACTIONS NEEDED

### TOP PRIORITY: WR Depth Crisis

Your team has FOUR WRs with Week 6 byes or issues. This creates an immediate starting lineup emergency.

### Waiver Wire Targets (Add These Players)

| Player | Position | Team | ROS Projected | Action | Drop Candidate |
|--------|----------|------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Romeo Doubs | WR | GB | 73.6 points | PICKUP | Trey Benson |
| A.T. Perry | WR | DEN | 63.1 points | PICKUP | Darren Waller |

### Why These Additions Are Critical:

1. Romeo Doubs: Recently dropped (0 days ago), trending with increased usage, provides immediate Week 6 starting capability
2. A.T. Perry: Recently dropped, has shown production potential

Drop Trey Benson - Inactive status makes him unplayable, roster spot better used for active WR depth

Drop Darren Waller - Redundant TE with Mark Andrews already rostered

## Injury & Roster Health Analysis

* Justin Jefferson & Jordan Addison: Both on BYE Week 6 - CANNOT START
* Trey Benson: Inactive status - UNPLAYABLE
* Drake London: Just added via waiver, Week 5 bye already passed

## Week 6 Starting Lineup Recommendation

QB: Lamar Jackson (BAL) RB1: Travis Etienne (JAX)
RB2: Breece Hall (NYJ) WR1: Keenan Allen (LAC) WR2: Davante Adams (LAR) WR3: Drake London (ATL) TE: Mark Andrews (BAL) FLEX: De'Von Achane (MIA) K: Brandon Aubrey (DAL) DEF: San Francisco (SF)

## Season-Long Strategy

### Trade Opportunities to Explore

Given your last-place waiver priority, trades become essential:

Target Roster 6 (1-4 record, struggling): May be willing to trade WR depth for RB help

Proposed Trade:

* Offer: De'Von Achane or Breece Hall
* Target: WR depth from struggling teams

### Waiver Priority Strategy

With waiver position 10, use priority aggressively for any player who can provide immediate Week 6 starting value.

## CRITICAL ACTION PLAN

1. IMMEDIATE: Add Romeo Doubs (drop Trey Benson)
2. IMMEDIATE: Add A.T. Perry (drop Darren Waller)
3. Set Week 6 lineup with Jefferson/Addison on bench
4. Monitor injury reports for any last-minute changes
5. Explore trades for additional WR depth

Your championship hopes are NOT slipping away - this is a manageable bye week crisis that can be solved with aggressive waiver wire moves and smart lineup management.
