### Current Roster Assessment

**Roster ID 1 (Andy ReiLu) - 3-1 Record, 583 Points For**

#### Starting Lineup Analysis:

| Player | Position | Projected Points | Opponent | Status | Recommendation |

| Lamar Jackson | QB | 7.7 | vs HOU | Doubtful (Hamstring) | Bench |
| Breece Hall | RB | 15.7 | vs MIN | Active | Start |
| De'Von Achane | RB | 21.7 | vs NE | Active | Start |
| Justin Jefferson | WR | 15.6 | vs NYJ | Active | Start |
| Davante Adams | WR | 15.1 | vs GB | Active | Start |
| Keenan Allen | WR | 14.1 | vs CLE | Active | Start |
| Mark Andrews | TE | 8.6 | vs HOU | Active | Start |
| Travis Etienne | RB | 13.3 | vs IND | Active | Start |
| Brandon Aubrey | K | 9.7 | vs PIT | Active | Start |

#### Key Issues Identified:

1. Lamar Jackson is DOUBTFUL with a hamstring injury
2. Current QB Depth: Jared Goff (18.4 projected) on bench
3. RB Depth: Strong with Breece Hall, De'Von Achane, Travis Etienne, Rachaad White
4. Upcoming Matchup: Against roster 3 (the undefeated team)

## RECOMMENDATION: DECLINE THE TRADE OFFER

### Reasoning:

#### 1. Positional Value Disparity

- Travis Etienne: Starting RB1 for Jacksonville, 13.3 projected points
- Baker Mayfield: Questionable with knee injury, only marginally better than Jared Goff

#### 2. Current QB Situation is Manageable

- Jared Goff (18.4 projected) is already on your bench
- The difference between Goff (18.4) and Mayfield (17.6) is negligible
- You would be giving up a starting RB for minimal QB upgrade

#### 3. Roster Construction Impact

- Current RB Depth: Etienne, Hall, Achane, White
- Losing Etienne would leave you with only 3 viable RBs
- RB scarcity makes Etienne much more valuable than Mayfield

#### 4. Injury Concerns

- Baker Mayfield: Questionable with knee injury
- Lamar Jackson: Expected to return soon (hamstring)

#### 5. Matchup Against Undefeated Team

- You need your strongest lineup possible
- Trading away a starting RB weakens your team significantly

### Alternative Strategy

**Start Jared Goff at QB**

- 18.4 projected points vs Baker Mayfield's 17.6
- Safer play with no injury concerns
- Maintains your RB depth

### Counter-Offer Consideration

If you want to pursue QB help, consider a more balanced trade:

**Potential Counter: Travis Etienne for a HIGHER-END QB**

- Target a QB like Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, or Jalen Hurts
- These would be more equitable trades for a starting RB

### Final Weekly Strategy

1. LINEUP DECISION: Start Jared Goff at QB, keep Travis Etienne at RB
2. WAIVER WIRE: Monitor for QB depth if Jackson remains out
3. TRADE GUIDANCE: Only consider trading Etienne for elite QB or WR upgrade
4. PRIORITY: Maintain RB depth while managing QB situation internally

This trade offer significantly undervalues Travis Etienne and would weaken your roster construction against the undefeated opponent.
