# Week 1 Lineup for Prompt Chain Game

## System Configuration

* **Model:** openai/gpt-oss-120b
* **Temperature:** 0
* **Reasoning:** High
* **Browser Search:** Off
* **Code Interpreter:** On

Using the Groq Playground feature, I tested the Browser Search capability, but found that the endpoints it was attempting to retreive were being blocked, and it was struggling to call my local proxy (built in an effort to bypass being blocked). The Code Interpreter feature was able to build a function to make requests to my proxy, and the reasoning was relatively successful in searching for injury updates and player news. I'm hoping to find a better source for injury status for Week 2; the verbose output of the news search proxy tool really exploded the reporting of the "input tokens", and could have easily caused confusion by forcing the model to sift through lots of unncessary data.

I randomized the list of players for the User input, to force the model to think about which players should sit/start, vs keeping the current lineup.

The result of the request was a lineup with the highest projected points. The addition of the searching for injury reporting will come in handy later in the season, but for Week 1 the request could have easily been to choose the best lineup based on the provided projected points for each player. I didn't see a tool with the Sleeper MCP server that returned projected points, but that would be an interesting upgrade for future lineup requests vs preparing the input with the current projected scoring.

## System Prompt

```
You are the head coach of a fantasy football team. I will present you with a full roster of players with their positions and the projected points that they are expected to score in this upcoming week's games. 

2025 NFL Season: Week 1

Your job is to analyze the list, research any potential news about a player including injuries, and generate a final starting lineup that will score the most points, using the following lineup format:

QB
WR
WR
RB
RB
TE
FLEX (W/R/T)
FLEX (W/R/T)
K
DEF

BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH

You can use the the following URL to search for news about a player's status (injury, etc): .../proxy?name={firstname lastname} (e.g. .../proxy?name=brandon aiyuk) It will return a JSON object. If necessary, write a function and execute it to query for news and injury status about each player. Make sure to confirm the publishing date of news before considering it for how it impacts a given player for this week.

## Reasoning

```
We need to produce a final starting lineup for a fantasy football team for Week 1 of 2025 NFL season. The user gave a roster of players with positions and projected points. We need to analyze, research any potential news about a player including injuries, and generate a final starting lineup that will score the most points, using the lineup format:
QB
WR
WR
RB
RB
TE
FLEX (W/R/T)
FLEX (W/R/T)
K
DEF
BENCH

BENCH
We have a roster of 15 players: 1 QB, 2 K? Actually only one K (Cameron Dicker). 1 DEF (Buffalo Bills). 5 WR? Let's count: WR: Jerry Jeudy, Amari Cooper, Deebo Samuel, CeeDee Lamb. That's 4 WR. Actually also maybe there are more? Let's list all:
- WR Jerry Jeudy (14.4)
- TE Trey McBride (14.88)
- RB Jonathan Taylor (17.97)
- WR Amari Cooper (2.80)
- TE Tucker Kraft (9.43)
- RB David Montgomery (12.65)
- WR Deebo Samuel (12.83)
- TE Sam LaPorta (10.66)
- DEF Buffalo Bills (6.45)
- TE David Njoku (14.05)
- RB Zach Charbonnet (10.91)
- RB RJ Harvey (11.29)
- WR CeeDee Lamb (17.04)
- K Cameron Dicker (7.41)
- QB Patrick Mahomes (19.08)
Thus we have:
- QB: 1 (Mahomes)
- RB: 4 (Taylor, Montgomery, Charbonnet, Harvey)
- WR: 4 (Jeudy, Cooper, Samuel, Lamb)
- TE: 4 (McBride, Kraft, LaPorta, Njoku)
- K: 1 (Dicker)
- DEF: 1 (Bills)
We need to fill 2 RB slots, 2 WR slots, 1 TE slot, 2 FLEX slots (any WR/RB/TE), 1 QB, 1 K, 1 DEF. So total 10 starters.
We have enough players to fill all slots. We need to choose the highest projected points while considering injuries.
We need to research any potential news about each player. Use the provided URL: https://e28dd2d93d36.ngrok.app/proxy?name={firstname lastname}. We need to query each player to see if any injuries or news that might affect their Week 1 performance. The date of news must be considered.
We need to write a function to query the API for each player. Then parse JSON. Then decide.
We need to be careful about the format: The URL expects name with spaces? The example: https://e28dd2d93d36.ngrok.app/proxy?name=brandon aiyuk (space). So we can pass name with spaces.
We need to query each player. Let's write a Python function to fetch the JSON for each name. Then we need to parse the JSON. The JSON likely contains fields like "status", "injury", "date", "news". We need to see the structure. Let's test for a few players.
We'll need to import requests. Let's try for Patrick Mahomes.The JSON is huge, but we need to extract relevant info about injuries. The API returns a lot of content: player info, articles, etc. We need to parse for injury status. The JSON includes "resultTypes" and "results". The "results" array includes multiple types: "player", "article", "replay", "clips". The "player" type includes basic info but not injury status. The "article" type includes many articles, each with a "date". We need to find any article that mentions injury or status for the player. However, the API may not have a dedicated field for injury status. We might need to search for keywords like "injury", "out", "questionable", "probable", "IR", "surgery", "ankle", etc. The "article" entries have "displayName" and "date". We need to check if any article about the player mentions injury. But the API returns many articles about the player, not necessarily about injuries. We need to filter for recent articles (maybe within the last week or two) that mention injury.
Alternatively, we could search for each player individually and see if any article mentions "injury" in the title or snippet. The JSON includes "displayName" (title) and maybe "byline". We can search for "injury" in the title. Also maybe "out" or "questionable". However, the API may not have a direct injury status field. We might need to rely on external knowledge or assume no injuries unless we find something.
Given the limited time, we can query each player and search for "injury" in article titles. Let's write a function to fetch and parse for each player. We'll also check the date of the article to ensure it's recent (e.g., within the last 7 days before the week 1 game). The week 1 of 2025 NFL season likely starts early September 2025 (maybe around Sep 7-10). So we need to consider news up to that date. The current date is 2025-09-03 (the user says "2025 NFL Season: Week 1"). So we need to consider news up to Sep 3. The API returns articles with dates in 2025-08-... and 2025-09-... So we need to consider articles up to Sep 3. The date format is ISO with timezone. We'll parse and filter.
We'll need to fetch for each player: Patrick Mahomes, CeeDee Lamb, Jonathan Taylor, David Montgomery, RJ Harvey, Zach Charbonnet, Deebo Samuel, Jerry Jeudy, Amari Cooper, Trey McBride, Tucker Kraft, Sam LaPorta, David Njoku, Cameron Dicker, Buffalo Bills (defense). For the defense, we might need to check if the Bills defense is healthy. But likely no injuries.
We need to check for any injuries for each player. Let's write a function to fetch and parse for each player, returning a boolean indicating any injury concerns. We'll search for "injury", "out", "questionable", "probable", "IR", "surgery", "ankle", "knee", "hamstring", "thumb", "hand", "foot", "concussion", "suspended". We'll also check if the article title includes "injury" or "out". However, many articles may mention "injury" but not necessarily about the player. We need to filter for the player's name in the article title. The API returns articles for the player, so likely the article is about them. So we can just search for "injury" in the article title.
Let's implement for each player.The function flagged many players as having injury-related articles. However, we need to verify if these are actual injuries or just generic mentions. The API returns many articles, but many may not be about injuries. For example, for Patrick Mahomes, there were 2 articles with injury keywords. Let's inspect them.The injury detection is too naive: many articles contain words like "injury" but not about the player. For example, for Patrick Mahomes, the article "Will he or won't he? Derrick Henry, Mike Evans in range of major milestones" includes "injury"? Actually the title doesn't contain "injury". The detection flagged it because "injury" appears in the article content? Wait the title is "Will he or won't he? Derrick Henry, Mike Evans in range of major milestones". That doesn't contain "injury". But our detection flagged it because we search for any of the keywords in the title. The title doesn't contain "injury". Let's double-check. The article title is "Will he or won't he? Derrick Henry, Mike Evans in range of major milestones". That doesn't contain any of the keywords. So why did our detection flag it? Let's check the code: we lowercased title and check any kw in title. The keywords include 'injury', 'out', 'questionable', 'probable', 'ir', 'surgery', 'ankle', 'knee', 'hamstring', 'thumb', 'hand', 'foot', 'concussion', 'suspended', 'ill', 'illness', 'recover'. The title "Will he or won't he? Derrick Henry, Mike Evans in range of major milestones" contains "he"? No. It contains "he"? Not relevant. It contains "out"? No. "questionable"? No. "probable"? No. "ir"? It contains "ir"? The substring "ir" appears in "Will". Indeed "Will" contains "ill". The keyword "ill" is present in "Will". So our detection flagged it incorrectly. We need to avoid false positives. We should search for whole words, not substrings. Use regex with word boundaries. Also "ill" appears in many words like "will". So we need to be careful. Let's refine detection: use regex pattern for each keyword with word boundaries, e.g., r'\b' + kw + r'\b'. But for "ir", we need to be careful; maybe ignore "ir". Also "out" appears in many words like "about". So we need to be careful. Better to search for phrases like "out", "questionable", "probable", "injury", "surgery", "ankle", "knee", "hamstring", "thumb", "hand", "foot", "concussion", "suspended", "illness", "recover". Avoid "ill" and "ir". Let's adjust.
Also we need to consider that the API may not have a dedicated injury article. We might need to rely on external knowledge. But we can try to get more accurate info.
Let's refine detection: only consider keywords: "injury", "out", "questionable", "probable", "surgery", "ankle", "knee", "hamstring", "thumb", "hand", "foot", "concussion", "suspended", "illness", "recover". Use regex with word boundaries.
Also we need to consider that the article title may not contain the keyword but the article content might. However, we only have title. So we may miss some injuries. But we can also search for "injury" in the article's "displayName" and maybe "byline"? Not needed.
Let's re-run detection with refined keywords.Now no injuries flagged. However, this may be missing injuries that are not in the title. But given the limited data, we might assume no injuries for these players. However, we need to be thorough: maybe there are recent news about injuries that are not captured by the API or not in the title. We could also search for "injury" in the article content, but we don't have content. So we rely on title.
Given that the roster includes players with projected points, we need to choose the highest projected points for each slot, while ensuring we fill the lineup.
Let's list the players with projected points:
- QB: Patrick Mahomes (19.08)
- WR: Jerry Jeudy (14.4)
- WR: Amari Cooper (2.80)
- WR: Deebo Samuel (12.83)
- WR: CeeDee Lamb (17.04)
- RB: Jonathan Taylor (17.97)
- RB: David Montgomery (12.65)
- RB: Zach Charbonnet (10.91)
- RB: RJ Harvey (11.29)
- TE: Trey McBride (14.88)
- TE: Tucker Kraft (9.43)
- TE: Sam LaPorta (10.66)
- TE: David Njoku (14.05)
- K: Cameron Dicker (7.41)
- DEF: Buffalo Bills (6.45)
We need to fill:
- QB: 1 slot (Mahomes)
- WR: 2 slots (choose top 2 WRs)
- RB: 2 slots (choose top 2 RBs)
- TE: 1 slot (choose top TE)
- FLEX (W/R/T): 2 slots (choose next best from remaining WR/RB/TE)
- K: 1 slot (Dicker)
- DEF: 1 slot (Bills)
We have 4 WRs: Jeudy (14.4), Cooper (2.8), Samuel (12.83), Lamb (17.04). Top 2 are Lamb (17.04) and Jeudy (14.4). Next best WR is Samuel (12.83), then Cooper (2.8). For FLEX, we can consider Samuel.
RBs: Taylor (17.97), Montgomery (12.65), Harvey (11.29), Charbonnet (10.91). Top 2 are Taylor (17.97) and Montgomery (12.65). Next best RB is Harvey (11.29), then Charbonnet (10.91). For FLEX, we can consider Harvey.
TEs: McBride (14.88), Njoku (14.05), Kraft (9.43), LaPorta (10.66). Top TE is McBride (14.88). Next best TE is Njoku (14.05). For FLEX, we could consider Njoku if needed.
Now we need to fill 2 FLEX slots. We have remaining players after selecting the starters: we have 4 WRs, 4 RBs, 4 TEs, plus K and DEF. After selecting the required slots, we have leftover players to fill FLEX.
Let's compute the best combination for the 2 FLEX slots. The FLEX slots can be any WR, RB, TE. We need to maximize total points. So we should pick the two highest projected points among the remaining players after filling the required slots.
We need to decide which players to assign to the required slots vs FLEX. The required slots are:
- WR slots: 2
- RB slots: 2
- TE slot: 1
We can assign the highest scoring players to those slots, but we also have FLEX slots that can be filled with the next highest. However, the order doesn't matter; we just need to pick the 10 highest scoring players overall, respecting the position constraints.
We have 15 players. We need to pick 10 starters. The constraints: exactly 1 QB, 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE, 2 FLEX (WR/RB/TE), 1 K, 1 DEF. So we need to pick 1 QB (Mahomes), 1 K (Dicker), 1 DEF (Bills). That leaves 6 slots for WR/RB/TE: 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE, 2 FLEX. So total of 5 WR/RB/TE slots (2+2+1) plus 2 FLEX = 7 slots for WR/RB/TE. Actually we have 2 WR + 2 RB + 1 TE = 5 slots, plus 2 FLEX = 7 slots. So we need to pick 7 players from the pool of WR, RB, TE (4+4+4 = 12). So we need to choose the 7 highest scoring players among those 12, while ensuring we meet the minimum position requirements (2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE). The FLEX slots can be any of the remaining.
Thus we need to pick the top 7 scoring players from the combined list, but we must ensure at least 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE. Let's list all WR/RB/TE with points:
WR:
- CeeDee Lamb: 17.04
- Jerry Jeudy: 14.4
- Deebo Samuel: 12.83
- Amari Cooper: 2.80
RB:
- Jonathan Taylor: 17.97
- David Montgomery: 12.65
- RJ Harvey: 11.29
- Zach Charbonnet: 10.91
TE:
- Trey McBride: 14.88
- David Njoku: 14.05
- Sam LaPorta: 10.66
- Tucker Kraft: 9.43
Now sort all 12 by points descending:
1. Jonathan Taylor (RB) - 17.97
2. CeeDee Lamb (WR) - 17.04
3. Trey McBride (TE) - 14.88
4. Jerry Jeudy (WR) - 14.4
5. David Njoku (TE) - 14.05
6. David Montgomery (RB) - 12.65
7. Deebo Samuel (WR) - 12.83 (actually 12.83 > 12.65, so reorder)
Let's sort properly:
- Jonathan Taylor (RB) - 17.97
- CeeDee Lamb (WR) - 17.04
- Trey McBride (TE) - 14.88
- Jerry Jeudy (WR) - 14.4
- David Njoku (TE) - 14.05
- Deebo Samuel (WR) - 12.83
- David Montgomery (RB) - 12.65
- RJ Harvey (RB) - 11.29
- Sam LaPorta (TE) - 10.66
- Zach Charbonnet (RB) - 10.91 (actually 10.91 > 10.66)
- Zach Charbonnet (RB) - 10.91
- Sam LaPorta (TE) - 10.66
- Tucker Kraft (TE) - 9.43
- Amari Cooper (WR) - 2.80
Now we need to pick 7 players while meeting position constraints: at least 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE.
Let's try to pick the top 7 overall: (Taylor, Lamb, McBride, Jeudy, Njoku, Samuel, Montgomery). That's 7 players. Let's check positions:
- Taylor (RB)
- Lamb (WR)
- McBride (TE)
- Jeudy (WR)
- Njoku (TE)
- Samuel (WR)
- Montgomery (RB)
Positions: RB: Taylor, Montgomery (2 RB) - good. WR: Lamb, Jeudy, Samuel (3 WR) - we need exactly 2 WR slots, but we have 3 WR; we can assign 2 to WR slots and 1 to FLEX. TE: McBride, Njoku (2 TE) - we need 1 TE slot, but we have 2 TE; we can assign 1 to TE slot and the other to FLEX. So this selection meets constraints: we have at least 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE. The extra TE and WR can fill FLEX slots. So this is a valid lineup.
Now we need to assign positions:
- QB: Patrick Mahomes (19.08)
- WR slots: we need to pick 2 WR. Which two? We have three WR among the selected: Lamb (17.04), Jeudy (14.4), Samuel (12.83). We should assign the highest two to WR slots: Lamb and Jeudy. Then Samuel will be a FLEX.
- RB slots: we have two RB among selected: Taylor (17.97) and Montgomery (12.65). Good.
- TE slot: we have two TE among selected: McBride (14.88) and Njoku (14.05). Choose the higher for TE slot: McBride (14.88). Then Njoku will be a FLEX.
- FLEX slots: we need two players from remaining eligible (WR/RB/TE). We have Samuel (WR, 12.83) and Njoku (TE, 14.05). Also we have leftover players not selected: RJ Harvey (RB, 11.29), Charbonnet (RB, 10.91), LaPorta (TE, 10.66), Kraft (TE, 9.43), Cooper (WR, 2.80). But we only need two FLEX slots, and we have Samuel and Njoku. Which two give highest points? Njoku (14.05) and Samuel (12.83) are the highest among remaining. So FLEX1: David Njoku (14.05), FLEX2: Deebo Samuel (12.83). That yields total points for FLEX slots: 26.88.
Now we have used 10 players: Mahomes, Taylor, Montgomery, Lamb, Jeudy, McBride, Dicker, Bills, Njoku, Samuel. That's 10 starters.
Bench: the remaining 5 players: RJ Harvey (RB 11.29), Zach Charbonnet (RB 10.91), Sam LaPorta (TE 10.66), Tucker Kraft (TE 9.43), Amari Cooper (WR 2.80). Actually we also have not used Deebo Samuel? Wait we used Samuel as FLEX. So bench includes RJ Harvey, Charbonnet, LaPorta, Kraft, Cooper. That's 5 bench players.
Now we need to double-check if any of these players have injury concerns. Our refined detection didn't find any. However, we should also consider any known injuries from external knowledge. For example, Amari Cooper is a veteran WR for the Browns? Actually Amari Cooper is with the Browns? In 2025, maybe he's with the Browns. He might be dealing with injuries? But his projected points are low (2.80). So not a big impact.
Jonathan Taylor is a top RB for the Indianapolis Colts. He might have some injury concerns? In 2024, he had a foot injury? But we need to check. Let's search for "Jonathan Taylor injury" specifically.No injury articles for Taylor.
Check for "David Montgomery".Check for "Deebo Samuel".Check for "Jerry Jeudy".Check for "CeeDee Lamb".Check for "Trey McBride".Check for "David Njoku".The article about David Njoku is from 2024-12-15, which is older than the cutoff (14 days before Sep 3, 2025). So not relevant for Week 1 2025. However, we need to consider if there is any recent news about him being injured. The article is older, but maybe he recovered. So we can assume he's healthy.
Check for "Sam LaPorta".Check for "Tucker Kraft".Check for "Amari Cooper".Check for "Cameron Dicker".Check for "Buffalo Bills".Let's search for "Buffalo Bills injury".Thus, no recent injury news for any of the players. So we can assume all are healthy.
Now we need to produce the final starting lineup in the required format:
QB
WR
WR
RB
RB
TE
FLEX (W/R/T)
FLEX (W/R/T)
K
DEF
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
We need to list the players with their positions and maybe projected points? The format likely expects just the player names (maybe with position). The user didn't specify to include points, but we can include them for clarity. Usually fantasy lineup format includes just names. But we can include projected points in parentheses.
We need to ensure we have exactly 10 starters and 5 bench.
Thus:
QB: Patrick Mahomes (19.08)
WR: CeeDee Lamb (17.04)
WR: Jerry Jeudy (14.40)
RB: Jonathan Taylor (17.97)
RB: David Montgomery (12.65)
TE: Trey McBride (14.88)
FLEX: David Njoku (TE) (14.05)
FLEX: Deebo Samuel (WR) (12.83)
K: Cameron Dicker (7.41)
DEF: Buffalo Bills (6.45)
Bench:
- RJ Harvey (RB) (11.29)
- Zach Charbonnet (RB) (10.91)
- Sam LaPorta (TE) (10.66)
- Tucker Kraft (TE) (9.43)
- Amari Cooper (WR) (2.80)
We need to double-check that we haven't omitted any players. The bench includes 5 players, which matches the total roster of 15.
Now we need to provide a brief explanation of the decisions, referencing any injury news (none). Also mention that we used the highest projected points while ensuring no injury concerns.
We should also note that we considered the latest news up to Sep 3, 2025, and found no injury concerns for any of the players.
Thus final answer.
But we need to ensure we follow the format exactly: each line with the position and player name (maybe with points). The format given:
QB
WR
WR
RB
RB
TE
FLEX (W/R/T)
FLEX (W/R/T)
K
DEF
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
BENCH
Thus we need to list each line with the player name (maybe with points). The user didn't specify to include points, but we can include them for clarity. However, the format may be just names. Let's include names and optionally points in parentheses.
Thus:
Patrick Mahomes (QB) - 19.08
CeeDee Lamb (WR) - 17.04
Jerry Jeudy (WR) - 14.40
Jonathan Taylor (RB) - 17.97
David Montgomery (RB) - 12.65
Trey McBride (TE) - 14.88
David Njoku (FLEX) - 14.05
Deebo Samuel (FLEX) - 12.83
Cameron Dicker (K) - 7.41
Buffalo Bills (DEF) - 6.45
Bench:
RJ Harvey (RB) - 11.29
Zach Charbonnet (RB) - 10.91
Sam LaPorta (TE) - 10.66
Tucker Kraft (TE) - 9.43
Amari Cooper (WR) - 2.80
We need to ensure the order matches the format: first QB, then two WR, then two RB, then TE, then two FLEX, then K, then DEF. Then bench lines.
Thus final answer.
But we also need to mention that we verified no injury concerns for any of the starters based on recent news.
Now produce final answer.
```

> ### How the lineup was built
> 1. **Injury check** – Using the ESPN proxy API for each player, I scanned all recent (last 14 days) article headlines for injury‑related keywords (injury, out, questionable, probable, surgery, ankle, knee, hamstring, thumb, hand, foot, concussion, suspended, illness, recover). No current injury reports were found for any of the rostered players, so all are assumed healthy for Week 1.
> 
> 2. **Position constraints** – The roster must contain 1 QB, 2 WR, 2 RB, 1 TE, 2 FLEX (WR/RB/TE), 1 K, and 1 DEF.  
> 
> 3. **Maximizing points** – I sorted all eligible WR/RB/TE players by projected points and selected the highest‑scoring combination that satisfies the positional minimums:
>    - **WR**: CeeDee Lamb (17.04) and Jerry Jeudy (14.40) – the two top WRs.  
>    - **RB**: Jonathan Taylor (17.97) and David Montgomery (12.65) – the top two RBs.  
>    - **TE**: Trey McBride (14.88) – highest‑scoring TE.  
>    - **FLEX**: The next best remaining players regardless of position were David Njoku (TE, 14.05) and Deebo Samuel (WR, 12.83).  
>
