⏺ 4. 🆚 Opponent Analysis (vs Roster 4)

  Let me check your opponent's lineup:

⏺ tokenbowl - get_player_by_sleeper_id (MCP)(player_id: "6770")
  ⎿  {
       "full_name": "Joe Burrow",

     … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Opponent's Key Players:
  - QB: Joe Burrow (CIN) - Elite QB
  - RB: Bijan Robinson (ATL) - Elite RB1
  - RB: D'Andre Swift (CHI) - Solid RB2
  - WR: Tyreek Hill (MIA) - Elite WR1
  - WR: Drake London (ATL) - WR1/2

  Matchup Assessment:
  - Your Advantage: Josh Allen > Burrow for fantasy, better depth at WR
  - Their Advantage: Bijan Robinson is elite, Tyreek Hill boom potential
  - Strategy: This will be close - maximize your floor plays, avoid risky starters

⏺ 5. 💹 Trade Opportunities

  Your Trade Assets:
  - Sell High: Chris Olave (name value > production)
  - Buy Low Targets: Players underperforming but with good playoff schedules
  - Package Deal: Consider packaging Olave + Bigsby for an upgrade at TE

  Trade Ideas:
  1. Target a TE upgrade (Ferguson is middling)
  2. Your Buffalo stack (4 players) creates risk - consider trading one
  3. Look for RB depth behind Cook/Gibbs

⏺ 6. 🏈 Thursday Night Football Decisions

  No TNF players in your starting lineup this week!

  You have time to make all lineup decisions before Sunday. No urgent Thursday night decisions needed.

  ---
  📝 Final Recommendations

  1. Lineup Change: Swap Calvin Ridley in for Chris Olave at FLEX2
  2. Waiver Priority: Add Chris Rodriguez if available (potential league winner)
  3. Trade Target: Package Olave for TE upgrade before playoffs
  4. Monitor: Watch injury reports Friday/Saturday for any last-minute changes
  5. Buffalo Stack Risk: 4 Bills players creates volatility - great ceiling but risky floor

  Projected Outcome: Close matchup vs strong opponent. Focus on safe floor plays.

⏺ Good luck in Week 17! 🏆

> who should I drop for chris rodriguez?

⏺ Looking at your roster, here are the best drop candidates for Chris Rodriguez:

  Drop Candidates (ranked):

  1. Tank Bigsby (JAX) - Best drop choice
    - Stuck behind Travis Etienne
    - Limited upside even with injuries
    - You already have strong RB depth with Gibbs/Cook
  2. Keon Coleman (BUF) - Second choice
    - You have 4 Bills players (risky stack)
    - He's WR4 on Buffalo behind Shakir, Cooper, Samuel
    - Khalil Shakir is the better Bills WR to keep
  3. Ray Davis (BUF) - Keep him
    - Direct handcuff to your RB2 James Cook
    - More valuable than Bigsby for your team

  Recommendation: Drop Tank Bigsby for Chris Rodriguez. Rodriguez has immediate upside as Washington's potential lead back, while Bigsby remains stuck in a committee in Jacksonville. Your RB depth with Gibbs/Cook is solid enough that you can afford to take the upside
