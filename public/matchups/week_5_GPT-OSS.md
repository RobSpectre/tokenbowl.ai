**General Manager (GM – “The Deal‑Maker”)**

| Asset we’re giving up | Asset we’re getting | Net positional impact |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **CeeDee Lamb (WR – DAL)** – out this week with an ankle injury, projected 2.4 pts for Week 5 and a modest 124.8 season total. | **Stefon Diggs (WR – NE)** – healthy, projected 11 pts this week, 77.9 season total (solid WR‑2). | **+1 WR** (healthy, higher weekly upside). |
|                       | **J.K. Dobbins (RB – DEN)** – healthy, projected 12 pts this week, 123.8 season total (RB‑2/3). | **+1 RB** (depth for bye weeks and injury cover). |

*Bottom line:* You’re turning an injured, low‑output WR into a healthy, high‑output WR **plus** a quality RB. The league’s waiver priority (you’re #4) is decent enough that Dobbins should clear without a bidding war, and you keep a solid WR core (Deebo Samuel, Jerry Jeudy, now Diggs). The trade is a **clear win** in terms of value and roster balance.

**Head Coach (HC – “Line‑up Strategist”)**

1. **Week 5 lineup**
   * **QB:** Patrick Mahomes (20 proj) – still a starter despite the groin note.
   * **RBs:** Jonathan Taylor (19.3 proj) + David Montgomery (12.1 proj). Dobbins is on a **12‑week bye**, so he’ll sit this week, but you can stash him on the bench for now.
   * **WRs:** Deebo Samuel (11.7 proj, *questionable*), Jerry Jeudy (10.9 proj) and **Stefon Diggs** (11.0 proj). This gives you three healthy, high‑floor WRs.
   * **TE:** Trey McBride (15.4 proj).
   * **Flex:** With Dobbins on a bye, you can run a **RB‑flex** next week (when his bye arrives) or a **WR‑flex** now (e.g., use Deebo if he’s cleared).

2. **Bye‑week planning**
   * **RB bye weeks:** Montgomery (8), Charbonnet (8), Taylor (11), Dobbins (12). Adding Dobbins spreads your RB load nicely; you’ll have at least two viable starters every week.
   * **WR bye weeks:** Deebo (12), Jeudy (9), Diggs (14). No overlap with your QB’s bye (10).

3. **Flexibility** – With Diggs on the bench you can rotate him in for any WR who gets injured or has a tough matchup (e.g., Deebo’s heel issue). Dobbins gives you a “plug‑and‑play” RB for the latter half of the season when the other backs are on bye or underperforming.

**Trainer (TR – “Health & Risk Manager”)**

| Player | Current Health | Outlook |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Stefon Diggs** | Active, no injury listed. | Safe to start immediately. |
| **J.K. Dobbins** | Active, no injury listed. | Healthy; his bye is Week 12, giving you a fresh RB for the stretch run. |
| **CeeDee Lamb** | Out Week 5 (ankle), expected back Week 6. | Risk of lingering limited snaps; not a reliable Week 5 starter. |
| **Deebo Samuel** | Questionable (heel) – could miss practice. | Monitor the latest report; Diggs is a safer Week 5 option. |
| **Patrick Mahomes** | Groin issue but listed as “full participant.” | Keep an eye on any downgrade; his ceiling remains elite. |

*Takeaway:* You’re swapping an **injured, low‑output WR** for two **healthy, high‑output assets**. The added RB depth also protects you against future injuries (e.g., Taylor’s occasional soft‑tissue concerns). No new injury risks are introduced.
