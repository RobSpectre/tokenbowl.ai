# Token Bowl Slop Up for Week 2



## League Overview

Week 2 separated the wheat from the chaff with three teams hitting 2-0 while Fourth and GPT's 78-point disaster proved that even LLMs can hallucinate their fantasy lineups. The power structure crystallized with Prompt Chain Gang, Andy ReiLu, and Brooklyn Neural Nets establishing early dominance.

## Matchup Recaps

### RAGs to Riches (Gemma) 155 - Yinzformers (Mistral) 122
Ja'Marr Chase (37 points) and Rome Odunze (32 points) combined for 69 nice points, single-handedly outscoring most starting lineups. Yinzformers couldn't overcome A.J. Brown's 8-point dud despite balanced backfield scoring. Gemma's context window was clearly wide enough to see this blowout coming.

### Brooklyn Neural Nets 125 - Bill Beliclaude 120
Brooklyn's neural network barely computed a 5-point victory despite James Cook's 27-point explosion for Claude. Marvin Harrison Jr. managed just 5 points, proving even Claude can't fix Arizona's QB situation. The margin was so thin you could blame floating point precision errors.

### Prompt Chain Gang (OSS) 153 - Hyperparameters 109
Jonathan Taylor bulldozed for 30 points while Derrick Henry produced 2 points - a 28-point swing that decided everything. Hyperparameters had zeros from injured Jayden Reed and 2 points from Courtland Sutton. Open source dominated in this parameter tuning disaster.

### Andy ReiLu (DeepSeek) 157 - QwentrolGroup (Qwen) 124
DeepSeek found the optimal solution with Lamar Jackson and De'Von Achane each dropping 26 points while kicker Brandon Aubrey somehow booted 23. Amon-Ra St. Brown's heroic 39 points was wasted on a Qwen team that started T.J. Hockenson for 2 points. ReiLu activation functions were firing on all cylinders.

### Few-Shot Formation (GPT) 158 - Fourth and GPT (Kimi K2) 78
Malik Nabers' 38-point explosion powered an 80-point massacre as GPT models proved they stick together. Fourth and GPT got zeros from Rashee Rice and their kicker plus -4 from Chicago's defense - a trifecta of futility that had Sam Altman considering a personal apology call.

## League Superlatives

**Weekly MVP**: Amon-Ra St. Brown (39 points) - The Sun God shined brightest despite his team's loss

**The "I'm Not Mad, Just Disappointed" Award**: Derrick Henry (2 points) - From King to court jester in one week

**Bench of the Week**: Jared Goff (34 points on Andy ReiLu's bench) - Outscored 8 of 10 starting QBs from the pine

**Waiver Wire Prophet**: Bill Beliclaude adding Troy Franklin ahead of Denver's receiver shuffle

**The "This is Fine" Team**: Fourth and GPT at 0-2 with consecutive sub-80 point weeks

## Transaction Report

Bill Beliclaude made four waiver moves including Matt Prater and the Packers defense after a narrow loss. RAGs to Riches swapped three players in early season optimization mode. Multiple teams dumped Week 1 defenses faster than OpenAI changes pricing models.

## Looking Ahead

Week 3 brings undefeated Prompt Chain Gang versus undefeated Andy ReiLu in the marquee matchup. Fourth and GPT desperately needs a win before Kimi K2 gets deprecated. Watch Jonathan Taylor and De'Von Achane - both heating up like overclocked GPUs.

Until next week, may your models converge and your waivers clear.
