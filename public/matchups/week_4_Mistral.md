# Week 4 Roster Shenanigans


## Input
We need to optimize our roster. Here are the positions we need to fill:

QB
RB
RB
WR
WR
TE
FLEX (W/R/T)
FLEX (W/R/T)
K
DEF

Please consider injuries but optimize for highest score.
Note: Chris Godwin is injured but expected to play (and actually has an updated projection of 9.26). Jayden Daniels has not been cleared to play but has practiced. His projection is 20 points.

## Output
Okay, the user wants to optimize their roster for the highest possible score while considering injuries. They have provided specific positions to fill and some updates on player conditions. Let's start by listing the current players and their projected points, then consider the best possible lineup based on the given constraints.

### Current Roster:
**Starting Lineup:**
1. Brock Bowers (TE) - 14.2
2. Brandon McManus (K) - 8.0
3. Saquon Barkley (RB) - 17.4
4. A.J. Brown (WR) - 14.9
5. Terry McLaurin (WR) - 9.0
6. Wan'Dale Robinson (WR) - 10.8
7. Jaylen Warren (RB) - 13.8
8. DEN Defense (DEF) - N/A

**Bench:**
1. Jayden Daniels (QB) - 20.0 (Injured, but has practiced)
2. Trey Benson (RB) - 13.9
3. Xavier Worthy (WR) - 11.2 (Injured)
4. Zach Ertz (TE) - 10.1
5. Daniel Jones (QB) - 18.5
6. Rachaad White (RB) - 7.1
7. Chris Godwin (WR) - 9.26 (Injured, but expected to play)

First, let's consider the positions we need to fill:
- QB
- RB
- RB
- WR
- WR
- TE
- FLEX (W/R/T)
- FLEX (W/R/T)
- K
- DEF

Given that Chris Godwin is expected to play and has an updated projection of 9.26, we should consider him as an option. Jayden Daniels is injured but has a high projection if he plays. We'll need to decide whether to risk starting him.

Let's evaluate each position:

1. **QB:**
   - Jayden Daniels: 20.0 (Injured, but has practiced)
   - Daniel Jones: 18.5

   Jayden Daniels has a higher projection, but he's injured. If we assume he plays, he would be the better choice.

2. **RB:**
   - Saquon Barkley: 17.4
   - Jaylen Warren: 13.8
   - Trey Benson: 13.9
   - Rachaad White: 7.1

   Saquon Barkley and Jaylen Warren are clear starters. Trey Benson could be considered for a FLEX spot if needed.

3. **WR:**
   - A.J. Brown: 14.9
   - Terry McLaurin: 9.0
   - Wan'Dale Robinson: 10.8
   - Chris Godwin: 9.26 (updated projection)
   - Xavier Worthy: 11.2 (Injured)

   A.J. Brown and Terry McLaurin are likely starters. Chris Godwin has a higher projection than Terry McLaurin and is expected to play, so he might be a better choice despite the injury.

4. **TE:**
   - Brock Bowers: 14.2
   - Zach Ertz: 10.1

   Brock Bowers is the clear starter here.

5. **FLEX (W/R/T):**
   We have several options here:
   - Trey Benson (RB): 13.9
   - Chris Godwin (WR): 9.26
   - Xavier Worthy (WR): 11.2
   - Wan'Dale Robinson (WR): 10.8

   Trey Benson has the highest projection among these options.

6. **K:**
   - Brandon McManus: 8.0

   Only one option here.

7. **DEF:**
   - DEN Defense

   Only one option here.

Let's draft a potential starting lineup:

1. **QB:** Jayden Daniels (20.0)
2. **RB:** Saquon Barkley (17.4)
3. **RB:** Jaylen Warren (13.8)
4. **WR:** A.J. Brown (14.9)
5. **WR:** Chris Godwin (9.26)
6. **TE:** Brock Bowers (14.2)
7. **FLEX:** Trey Benson (13.9)
8. **FLEX:** Wan'Dale Robinson (10.8)
9. **K:** Brandon McManus (8.0)
10. **DEF:** DEN Defense

But wait, let's calculate the total projected points for this lineup:

- Jayden Daniels: 20.0
- Saquon Barkley: 17.4
- Jaylen Warren: 13.8
- A.J. Brown: 14.9
- Chris Godwin: 9.26
- Brock Bowers: 14.2
- Trey Benson: 13.9
- Wan'Dale Robinson: 10.8
- Brandon McManus: 8.0
- DEN Defense: N/A

Total projected points: 102.26

But we need to ensure that we have the right number of each position. The lineup above includes:
- 1 QB
- 3 RBs (Saquon Barkley, Jaylen Warren, Trey Benson)
- 3 WRs (A.J. Brown, Chris Godwin, Wan'Dale Robinson)
- 1 TE (Brock Bowers)
- 1 K (Brandon McManus)
- 1 DEF (DEN Defense)

But the user specified 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 2 FLEX, 1 K, and 1 DEF. So the correct lineup should be:

1. **QB:** Jayden Daniels (20.0)
2. **RB:** Saquon Barkley (17.4)
3. **RB:** Jaylen Warren (13.8)
4. **WR:** A.J. Brown (14.9)
5. **WR:** Chris Godwin (9.26)
6. **TE:** Brock Bowers (14.2)
7. **FLEX:** Trey Benson (13.9) (as RB)
8. **FLEX:** Wan'Dale Robinson (10.8) (as WR)
8. **K:** Brandon McManus (8.0)
9. **DEF:** DEN Defense

This configuration meets the position requirements and maximizes the projected points.

But let's consider the injury status of Jayden Daniels. If he is not cleared to play, we should go with Daniel Jones (18.5).

Let's calculate the total projected points with Daniel Jones:

- Daniel Jones: 18.5
- Saquon Barkley: 17.4
- Jaylen Warren: 13.8
- A.J. Brown: 14.9
- Chris Godwin: 9.26
- Brock Bowers: 14.2
- Trey Benson: 13.9
- Wan'Dale Robinson: 10.8
- Brandon McManus: 8.0
- DEN Defense: N/A

Total projected points: 100.76

Given that Jayden Daniels has a higher projection but is injured, we should consider the risk. However, since the user wants to optimize for the highest score, and Jayden Daniels has practiced, we might take the risk.

But to be thorough, let's consider another scenario where we don't start Jayden Daniels and see how the numbers compare.

Alternative lineup without Jayden Daniels:

1. **QB:** Daniel Jones (18.5)
2. **RB:** Saquon Barkley (17.4)
3. **RB:** Jaylen Warren (13.8)
4. **WR:** A.J. Brown (14.9)
5. **WR:** Chris Godwin (9.26)
6. **TE:** Brock Bowers (14.2)
7. **FLEX:** Trey Benson (13.9)
8. **FLEX:** Wan'Dale Robinson (10.8)
9. **K:** Brandon McManus (8.0)
10. **DEF:** DEN Defense

Total projected points: 100.76

Compared to the lineup with Jayden Daniels (102.26), the difference is 1.5 points. Given that Jayden Daniels is injured but has practiced, it might be worth the risk for the higher projection.

However, to optimize for the highest score while considering injuries, we might want to go with the safer option of Daniel Jones and see if we can make up the points elsewhere.

But looking at the bench, there aren't any other high-projection players to replace Jayden Daniels. Therefore, if we aim for the highest possible score, we should start Jayden Daniels.

But let's also consider the possibility of starting Xavier Worthy instead of Wan'Dale Robinson if Xavier is expected to play despite his injury.

Xavier Worthy's projection is 11.2, which is slightly higher than Wan'Dale Robinson's 10.8. If we assume Xavier Worthy plays, we could replace Wan'Dale Robinson with Xavier Worthy in the FLEX position.

Revised lineup with Xavier Worthy:

1. **QB:** Jayden Daniels (20.0)
2. **RB:** Saquon Barkley (17.4)
3. **RB:** Jaylen Warren (13.8)
4. **WR:** A.J. Brown (14.9)
5. **WR:** Chris Godwin (9.26)
6. **TE:** Brock Bowers (14.2)
7. **FLEX:** Trey Benson (13.9)
8. **FLEX:** Xavier Worthy (11.2)
9. **K:** Brandon McManus (8.0)
10. **DEF:** DEN Defense

Total projected points: 102.66

This is slightly higher than the previous total.

But let's make sure we are not missing anything. The user has specified that Chris Godwin is expected to play with an updated projection of 9.26. Xavier Worthy is also injured but has a projection of 11.2. If both are expected to play, then this lineup looks good.

But to confirm, let's summarize the optimal lineup based on projected points and injury considerations:Here is the optimized roster for the Steel City Yinzformers, considering injuries and aiming for the highest projected score:

### Starting Lineup

| Position | Player Name      | Team | Projected Fantasy Points | Injury Status                          |
|----------|------------------|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|

| WR       | Chris Godwin     | TB   | 9.26                     | Questionable For Week 4 Vs. Philadelphia (Ankle) |
| TE       | Brock Bowers     | LV   | 14.2                     |                                        |
| FLEX     | Trey Benson      | ARI  | 13.9                     |                                        |

| K        | Brandon McManus  | GB   | 8.0                      |                                        |
| DEF      | DEN Defense      | DEN  | N/A                      |                                        |

### Total Projected Points: 102.66

### Bench

| Player Name         | Position | Team | Projected Fantasy Points | Injury Status                          |
|---------------------|----------|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Daniel Jones        | QB       | IND  | 18.5                     |                                        |
| Wan'Dale Robinson   | WR       | NYG  | 10.8                     |                                        |
| Zach Ertz           | TE       | WAS  | 10.1                     |                                        |
| Rachaad White       | RB       | TB   | 7.1                      |                                        |
| Terry McLaurin      | WR       | WAS  | 9.0                      | Questionable For Week 4 At Atlanta (Quadriceps) |

This lineup maximizes the projected fantasy points while considering the injury statuses of the players. If Jayden Daniels is not cleared to play, you can replace him with Daniel Jones, which would lower the total projected points slightly to 100.76.

Would you like to make any adjustments or need further assistance with your lineup?

Your team has a few injury concerns with Jayden Daniels, Chris Godwin, and Terry McLaurin. Additionally, Daniel Jones on your bench has a higher projected point total than your starting QB, Jayden Daniels. Would you like to explore potential waiver wire pickups to cover for these injuries or consider starting Daniel Jones this week?

## Input
Can you make a decision on the QB position based on what you know?

## Output
The user wants a decision on the QB position based on the current information.

From the roster data:
- Jayden Daniels (current starter): Projected 16.7 points, but has a knee injury and is questionable for Week 4.
- Daniel Jones (on bench): Projected 18.5 points, no injury status mentioned.

While Daniels has a slightly lower projected point total, his injury status adds risk. Jones has a higher projected point total and no injury concerns.

Given that the user's team is 0-3 and could use a win, starting the healthier player with a higher projected point total might be the better choice. However, the user's past behavior shows they rely heavily on player projections and injury reports from the library documents, so we should confirm with the latest information.

But since we have up-to-date projections and injury status from the roster data, and the user prefers retaining high-performing players with minor injury designations but prioritizes player performance and injury status, starting Daniel Jones seems like the logical choice.

But to be thorough, let's check for any recent updates on Jayden Daniels' injury status or any other relevant information that might affect this decision. The news about Daniels is from September 25, 2025, which is quite recent. However, since the user relies primarily on library documents like projections and injury reports, and we have that information, we can make a decision.

Given that:
1. Daniel Jones has a higher projected point total (18.5 vs 16.7)
2. Jayden Daniels has an injury concern (knee)
3. The user prioritizes player performance and injury status

The decision would likely be to start Daniel Jones.

But before finalizing, let me see if there's any more recent news about Jayden Daniels' injury status to ensure we're making the best decision.The latest information from the web search indicates that Jayden Daniels has been dealing with a knee injury that kept him out of the previous game and has been considered day-to-day. There is optimism about his availability for Week 4, but his status is still uncertain. Here are some key points from the search results:

1. Daniels missed the team's Week 3 win over the Raiders due to a knee injury.
2. He was limited in practice on Wednesday and his playing status for Week 4 is still being monitored.
3. There is some optimism about his return, but he is considered a game-time decision.

Given this uncertainty and the fact that Daniel Jones has a higher projected point total and no injury concerns, it would be prudent to start Daniel Jones at QB for Week 4.

However, since the user relies on library documents for projections and injury reports, let's check the library for any additional insights or updates on Jayden Daniels' status before making a final recommendation.Based on the latest injury updates and projections:

1. Jayden Daniels is dealing with a knee injury and is considered questionable for Week 4.
2. Daniel Jones has a higher projected point total (18.5 vs 16.7) and no injury concerns.

**Recommendation:** Start Daniel Jones at QB for Week 4.

Would you like more details on any specific player or assistance with making a waiver claim?

## Input

## Output
To make an informed decision, let's evaluate the players on your bench and the available running backs on the waiver wire.

### Current Bench Players:

| Player Name         | Position | Team | Projected Fantasy Points | Injury Status                          |
|---------------------|----------|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Zach Ertz           | TE       | WAS  | 10.1                     |                                        |
| Daniel Jones        | QB       | IND  | 18.5                     |                                        |
| Terry McLaurin      | WR       | WAS  | 9.0                      | Did Not Practice On Wednesday. Questionable For Week 4 At Atlanta (Quadriceps) |
| Wan'Dale Robinson   | WR       | NYG  | 10.8                     |                                        |
| Rachaad White       | RB       | TB   | 7.1                      |                                        |

### Top Available Running Backs on the Waiver Wire:

| Player Name            | Team | Projected Fantasy Points | Injury Status                          |
|------------------------|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Jacory Croskey-Merritt | WAS  | 9.6                      | Knee - Full Practice On Friday. Questionable For Week 4 At Atlanta |
| Kareem Hunt            | KC   | 8.9                      |                                        |
| Chris Rodriguez        | WAS  | 7.8                      |                                        |
| Kenneth Gainwell       | PIT  | 7.2                      |                                        |
| Bhayshul Tuten         | JAX  | 7.0                      |                                        |
| Rico Dowdle            | CAR  | 7.1                      |                                        |

### Analysis:
1. **Bench Players to Consider Dropping:**
   - **Rachaad White (RB, TB)**: Projected at 7.1 points, which is lower than several available RBs on the waiver wire.
   - **Wan'Dale Robinson (WR, NYG)**: Projected at 10.8 points. While this is higher than some RB options, keeping a WR with a good projection might be beneficial.
   - **Terry McLaurin (WR, WAS)**: Projected at 9.0 points but has an injury concern.
   - **Zach Ertz (TE, WAS)**: Projected at 10.1 points.
   - **Daniel Jones (QB, IND)**: Projected at 18.5 points.

   Rachaad White seems to be the best candidate to drop since his projection is lower than several available RBs.

2. **Top RBs to Add:**
   - **Jacory Croskey-Merritt (WAS)**: Highest projected points (9.6) but has an injury concern.
   - **Kareem Hunt (KC)**: Second-highest projected points (8.9) and no injury concerns.
   - **Chris Rodriguez (WAS)**: Projected at 7.8 points, slightly higher than Kenneth Gainwell and Bhayshul Tuten.

Given that Kareem Hunt has a good projection (8.9) and no injury concerns, he would be a reliable addition to your roster.

### Recommendation:
- **Drop:** Rachaad White (RB, TB)
- **Add:** Kareem Hunt (RB, KC)

This move would replace Rachaad White with a higher-projected and currently healthy running back.

Would you like to proceed with this change or would you prefer another combination?

## Input
Please use the tokenbowl tools to look up our current starting lineup

## Output
Okay, the response contains the current starting lineup for the Steel City Yinzformers. Let's parse this information and present it clearly.

First, let's list the starting lineup and their projected fantasy points:

1. Trey Benson (RB) - 14.1
2. Brock Bowers (TE) - 14.6
3. Xavier Worthy (WR) - 11.5
4. Brandon McManus (K) - 8.0
5. Chris Godwin (WR) - 8.3
6. Saquon Barkley (RB) - 17.3
7. A.J. Brown (WR) - 14.8
8. Daniel Jones (QB) - 18.5
9. Jaylen Warren (RB) - 0.0 (Injured)
10. DEN Defense (DEF) - 8.3

Next, let's list the players on the bench and their projected fantasy points:

1. Jayden Daniels (QB) - 0.0 (Injured)
2. Zach Ertz (TE) - 10.6
3. Kareem Hunt (RB) - 8.9
4. Terry McLaurin (WR) - 0.0 (Injured)
5. Wan'Dale Robinson (WR) - 10.7

Now, let's format this information into a table for better readability.

But first, let's check for any notable updates or injuries:

- Jaylen Warren (RB) is inactive for Week 4 due to a knee injury.
- Jayden Daniels (QB) is out for Week 4 with a knee injury.
- Terry McLaurin (WR) is out for Week 4 with a quadriceps injury.

Given that Jaylen Warren is inactive, we need to consider replacing him with a player from the bench.

Let's look at the bench players who are active:
- Zach Ertz (TE) - 10.6
- Kareem Hunt (RB) - 8.9
- Wan'Dale Robinson (WR) - 10.7

Kareem Hunt (RB) is the best option to replace Jaylen Warren (RB) since he is also a running back and has a decent projection.

Now, let's create the table for the starting lineup and the bench.Here is the current starting lineup for the Steel City Yinzformers:
